= FDTKit Installation Guide =

== Introduction ==

This Install Guide assumes you already have the Required Environment (listed below) installed. If you are starting from scratch please read the [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide] to setup your environment and then return to this document.

== Requirements ==
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/main.php Eclipse] - Any flavor of Eclipse should do but the Web Tools Platform Project 1.5.x all-in-one is what I recommend for most flash developers.
  * [http://fdt.powerflasher.com/update/ FDT 1.5.x] - FDT3 will be supported on its release and once I get a copy ;)
  * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html Subclipse] - the Subversion Eclipse Plugin you'll likely use as the main install/update route.
