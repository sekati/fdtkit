= FDTKit Installation Guide =


== Introduction ==

_This Install Guide assumes you already have the Required Environment (listed below) installed. If you are starting from scratch please read the [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide] to setup your environment and then return to this document._

  === Requirements ===
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/main.php Eclipse] - Any flavor of Eclipse should do but the [http://www.bea.com/callisto/eclipse.html Web Tools Platform Project 1.5.x all-in-one] is what I recommend for most flash developers.
  * [http://fdt.powerflasher.com/update/ FDT 1.5.x] - FDT3 will be supported once it is released and I attain a copy.
  * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html Subclipse]^*^ - Not required but strongly recommended as this is the best install and update route for FDTKit.


  === Install Routes ===
  * [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/source From the Project SVN Repository] via the Subclipse eclipse Plugin - (most desirable).
  * [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/downloads/list  From the Project Downloads Section] - (least desireable). 

To understand why [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software) SVN] is the more desirable route it is helpful to quickly review a few core concepts on how Eclipse, Subclipse and FDTKit fit together:

Eclipse is a plugin-based IDE _(supporting multiple languages, usages and functionalities)_. We build our Flash IDE with the FDT plugin _(which adds advanced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript ActionScript] support)_ and Subclipse plugin _(which allows Subversion version control support)_.

Simply put; FDTKit is a treated as a _Generic Project_ in Eclipse; which means you can check out, or update the latest version from the project repository and have it available on your system - all directly from Eclipse. This is handy since all FDTKit is, in essence, is a collection of tool meant to help _complete_ the IDE in a centralized way by adding the necessary libraries, compilers, documentation tools, scripts, etc.


== Install via SVN ==

  # From the Eclipse toolbar: `"Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> SVN Repository Exporing"`. 
  # Right-click in the `"SVN Repository"` panel and select: `"New -> Repository Location..."`.
  # Enter: _"[http://fdtkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ http://fdtkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/]"_ in the URL field and click: `"Finish"`.
  # The SVNKit repository will now be added to your `"SVN Repository"` panel.
  # Right click on the repository and choose: `"Checkout..."`.
  # Insure that the default: `"Check out as a project in the workspace"` is ticked, the Project Name is: `"fdtkit"`, and `"Head Revision"` is ticked. Then press: `"Finish"`.
  # Wait while the current build of FDTKit is downloaded and installed; once complete you should see `"Checked out revision [number]."` in the `Console` panel. 
  # Thats it; you're now ready to configure FDT to use FDTKit. To switch back to the `"Flash Perspective"` from the Eclipse toolbar: `"Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Flash (default)"`. 


== Install via Download ==

  # Download the latest revision archive from the [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/downloads/list Project Download page].
  # Unzip the archive into your eclipse workspace directory.
  # Rename the directory from `fdtkit-revXX` to `fdtkit`.
  # From the Eclipse toolbar: `"File -> New -> Project... -> General -> Project"` and press `"Next"`.
  # Enter `"fdtkit"` as the Project Name and make sure `"Use default workspace"` is ticked. Press `"Finish"`.
  # Thats it; you're now ready to configure FDT to use FDTKit.


== Configuratation ==


== Updating FDTKit ==

  * To update via SVN: Right-click on the `fdtkit` project in `Flash Explorer` panel and choose `Team -> Update`
  * To update via Download: Delete the `fdtkit` project and files, then repeat the instructions from _Install via Download_ (and consider confronting your fear of Subversion ... you'll thank me later! ;) 


== Using FDTKit ==

Please see the FDTKit [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Documentation Documentation] for specific usages.
