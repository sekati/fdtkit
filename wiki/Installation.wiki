= FDTKit Installation Guide =


== Introduction ==

This Install Guide assumes you already have the Required Environment (listed below) installed. If you are starting from scratch please read the [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide] to setup your environment and then return to this document.

== Requirements ==
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/main.php Eclipse] - Any flavor of Eclipse should do but the [http://www.bea.com/callisto/eclipse.html Web Tools Platform Project 1.5.x all-in-one] is what I recommend for most flash developers.
  * [http://fdt.powerflasher.com/update/ FDT 1.5.x] - FDT3 will be supported once it is released and I attain a copy.
  * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html Subclipse]^*^ - Not required but strongly recommended as this is the best install and update route for FDTKit.
