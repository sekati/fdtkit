= FDTKit Installation Guide =



== Introduction ==

_This Install Guide assumes you already have the Required Environment (listed below) installed. If you are starting from scratch please read the [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide] to setup your environment and then return to this document._

  === Requirements ===
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/main.php Eclipse] - Any flavor of Eclipse should do but the [http://www.bea.com/callisto/eclipse.html Web Tools Platform Project 1.5.x all-in-one] is what I recommend for most flash developers.
  * [http://fdt.powerflasher.com/update/ FDT 1.5.x] - FDT3 will be supported once it is released and I attain a copy.
  * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html Subclipse]^*^ - Not required but strongly recommended as this is the best install and update route for FDTKit.


  === Install Options ===
  * [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/source From the Project SVN Repository] via the Subclipse eclipse Plugin - (most desirable).
  * [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/downloads/list  From the Project Downloads Section] - (least desireable). 

To understand why [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software) SVN] is the more desirable route it is helpful to quickly review a few core concepts on how Eclipse, Subclipse and FDTKit fit together:

Eclipse is a plugin-based IDE _(supporting multiple languages, usages and functionalities)_. We build our Flash IDE with the FDT plugin _(which adds advanced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript ActionScript] support)_ and Subclipse plugin _(which allows Subversion version control support)_.

Simply put; FDTKit is a treated as a _Generic Project_ in Eclipse; which means you can check out, or update the latest version from the project repository and have it available on your system - all directly from Eclipse. This is handy since all FDTKit is, in essence, is a collection of tool meant to help _complete_ the IDE in a centralized way by adding the necessary libraries, compilers, documentation tools, scripts, etc.


== Installing from SVN ==

  # From the Eclipse toolbar: `Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> SVN Repository Exporing` 
  # Right-click in the `SVN Repository` panel and select: `New -> Repository Location...`
  # Enter: `http://fdtkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/` in the URL field and click: `Finish`
  # The SVNKit repository will not be added to your `SVN Repository` panel
  # Right click on the repository and choose: `Checkout...`
  # Insure that the default: `Check out as a project in the workspace` is ticked, the Project Name is: `fdtkit`, and `Head Revision` is ticked. Then press: `Finish`.
