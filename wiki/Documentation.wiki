== Introduction ==

Assuming you have already installed [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse] & [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Installation FDTKit] you are ready to start using your new environment. So, lets start by creating a test project and continue customizing our environment.

== Create a new Project ==
  # First we must make sure we are in the _Flash Perspective_ by going to "Window -> Open Perspective -> Flash".
  # "File -> New -> New Flash Project".
  # Enter "Test Project" for "Project Name", insuring that "Use Default Location" is checked and hit "Next".
  # Select your default "Core Library" (based on your target FlashPlayer version). If you would like to use a different Core Library simply press "Change Core Library" and select the version you would like (these will already be available via FDTKit installation).
  # Press "Finish" and your project will be created. You may see this in the "Flash Explorer" panel ("Window -> Show View -> Flash Explorer).
 

== Create a Source Folder ==
  # Now we need a project source folder to keep our classes in.  We so this simply by right-clicking our "Test Project" in the Flash Explorer.
  # Choose "New -> Source Folder" which we will name "src".


== Create a Class ==
  # Right click on our project "src" folder and choose "New -> Class".
  # In the "Create AS2 Class" wizard fill in our package: "com.sekati.core", classname:"Test", superclass:"MovieClip".
  # Press "Finish". Our class has been created, you may view it by expanding the "src" folder to see our package and its class contents. 
 

== Create an Fla ==
  # Right click on our project "src" folder and choose "New -> Fla".
  # In the "New Fla" wizard fill in our fla name: "Main.fla"
  # Press "Finish". Our fla has been created.
  # Double click the "Main.fla" in our "src" folder and the Flash IDE will launch and open the Fla.
  # Next go to "Publish Settings" in the Flash IDE and set the FlashPlayer Version for the FLA to match your Core Library.
