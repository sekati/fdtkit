== Introduction ==

Assuming you have already installed [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse] & [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Installation FDTKit] you are ready to start using your new environment. So, lets start by creating a test project and continue customizing our environment.

== Create a new Project ==
  # First we must make sure we are in the _Flash Perspective_ by going to "Window -> Open Perspective -> Flash".
  # "File -> New -> New Flash Project".
  # Enter "Test Project" for "Project Name", insuring that "Use Default Location" is checked and hit "Next".
  # Select your default "Core Library" (based on your target FlashPlayer version). If you would like to use a different Core Library simply press "Change Core Library" and select the version you would like (these will already be available via FDTKit installation).
