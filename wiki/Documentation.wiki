== Introduction ==

Assuming you have already installed [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse] & [http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Installation FDTKit] you are ready to start using your new environment. So, lets start by creating a test project and continue customizing our environment.

== Create a new Project ==
  # First we must make sure we are in the _Flash Perspective_ by going to `"Window -> Open Perspective -> Flash"`
  # `"File -> New -> New Flash Project"` 
  # Enter `"Test Project"` for "Project Name", insuring that `"Use Default Location"` is checked and hit `"Next"`
