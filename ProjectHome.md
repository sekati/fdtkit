The goal of FDTKit is to help flash developers build and maintain a standard Eclipse/FDT environment through a **centralized multi-platform toolkit** of open source tools, libraries, scripts, templates and documentation.

While the toolkit is largely geared towards newcomers to Eclipse/FDT, and is some respects can be treated as a set of _'missing manuals and tools'_, the centralized collection of the various components that make up FDTKit should prove a worthwhile resource to anyone who desires a standardized central toolkit as a base for their IDE.

In fact, FDTKit was created as I moved to (and learned) the Eclipse/FDT environment and desired to centralize the all the peripherals required to build a comfortable environment and keep them in sync between workstations via SVN.

FDTKit is [distributed as an eclipse project via subversion](http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/source) which means you may [Install FDTKit](http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Installation) in to your existing eclipse/FDT environment or follow the [Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide](http://code.google.com/p/fdtkit/wiki/Eclipse_FDT_Subclipse_Install_Guide) to get your new environment up and running, and then Install FDTKit.

Additionally, because FDTKit is delivered thru subversion which eclipse supports via the Subclipse plugin - you can easily install and update FDTKit in just a few clicks of eclipse.

The FDTKit repository can also be viewed [with a web browser](http://fdtkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/).

**_Important update notice:_** - [FDT 3](http://fdt.powerflasher.com/) has been released by powerflashers. ~~FDTKit is currently waiting for an Open Source Project license to be granted by PowerFlashers in order to complete the porting and documentation to this new version.~~ FDTKit is now fully FDT3 compatible; while most of the wiki pages still hold true slight modifications will be made to bring them up to date shortly. _More coming soon ...._
