I. Introduction

	The goal of FDTKit is to help flash developers build and maintain a standard 
	Eclipse/FDT environment through a centralized multi-platform toolkit of open 
	source tools, libraries, scripts, templates and documentation.

	While the toolkit is largely geared towards newcomers to Eclipse/FDT, and is 
	some respects can be treated as a set of 'missing manuals and tools', the 
	centralized collection of the various components that make up FDTKit should 
	prove a worthwhile resource to anyone who desires a standardized central 
	toolkit as a base for their IDE.

	In fact, FDTKit was created as I moved to (and learned) the Eclipse/FDT 
	environment and desired to centralize the all the peripherals required to 
	build a comfortable environment and keep them in sync between workstations 
	via SVN.

	FDTKit is distributed as an eclipse project via subversion which means you 
	may Install FDTKit in to your existing eclipse/FDT environment or follow the 
	Eclipse, FDT, Subclipse Install Guide to get your new environment up and 
	running, and then Install FDTKit.

	Additionally, because FDTKit is delivered thru subversion which eclipse supports 
	via the Subclipse plugin - you can easily install and update FDTKit in just a 
	few clicks of eclipse.

II. Documentation
	
	Specific attention has been paid to writing thorough and concise Documentation for 
	the API and generating useful Unit Tests to allow the framework to be easily tapped
	and referenced as needed.
