  <p><a name="_DV_M55"></a><span style='"MS Mincho"'>8.             General
    Provisions. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it
    will not affect the validity of the balance of this Agreement, which shall
    remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.  The English version of this Agreement shall
    be the version used when interpreting or construing this Agreement.  This is the entire agreement between Adobe

    once every twelve (12) months, appoint its own personnel or an independent
    third party to verify the number of copies and installations as well as usage
    of the Adobe software in use by Licensee.  Any such verification shall be conducted upon seven (7) business days
    notice, during regular business hours at Licensee’s offices and shall not
    unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities.  Both Adobe and its auditors shall execute a
    commercially reasonable non-disclosure agreement with Licensee before
    proceeding with the verification.  If
    such verification shows that Licensee is using a greater number of copies of
    the Software than that legitimately licensed, or are deploying or using the
    Software in any way not permitted under this Agreement and which would require
    additional license fees, Licensee shall pay the applicable fees for such
    additional copies within thirty (30) days of invoice date, with such underpaid
    fees being the license fees as per Adobe’s then-current, country specific,
    license fee list.  If underpaid fees are
    in excess of five percent (5%) of the value of the fees paid under this
    Agreement, then Licensee shall pay such underpaid fees and Adobe’s reasonable costs
    of conducting the verification.</span></p>

    Agreement, with the right to enforce the obligations set forth herein with
    respect to the respective technology of such licensors and/or Adobe.</span></p>
